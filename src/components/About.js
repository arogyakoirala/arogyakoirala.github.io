        <p className="m-0 mt-2 pb-0">I am an information professional currently pursuing the Master of Information Management and Systems (MIMS) program at UC Berkeley School of Information. I have seven years of experience in designing and developing data-driven, web and mobile based information systems for corporations, government agencies, and civil-society organizations in the US, India, and Nepal. My work so far has centered around the design and development of systems that generate (or ingest), analyze, and visualize complex data.</p>

        <br />

        Prior to Berkeley, I was the Tech and Innovation Lead of <a href="https://kathmandulivinglabs.org">Kathmandu Living Labs</a> (KLL), where I led the design and development of numerous web and mobile development projects in areas such as disaster risk reduction, citizen science, good governance, and open data. In 2020, I led the design, development, and testing of Baato, Nepalâ€™s first cloud based geospatial services company. Before KLL, I was a Decision Scientist for Mu Sigma Inc, where I worked on data analytics projects with numerous Fortune 500 companies in the banking, technology, and retail domains.

        <br />
        <br />

        My passion lies at the intersection of data, people, and systems. I am currently seeking summer internship opportunities in data science, user research, or product design. I prefer to work with companies that have a strong emphasis on learning, mentorship and teamwork.
